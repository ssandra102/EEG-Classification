# EEG Classification for wheelchair automation

Contains model developed for self-recordedd single channel EEG motor task dataset. Additionaly, compares the performance with already establised models(EEGNet, Shallow-Conv, DeepConv) with respect to the complexity, temporal and spatial features, number of channels etc.
Data recorded from EXG-Bio Amp pill from Upside-Down Labs, using 3 electrodes(forming a single channel). 

## Usage

Run the jupyter files to perform data loading, data transformation, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
